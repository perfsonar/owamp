# Build Order for pScheduler Packages for use with Unibuild
#

# Packages must be listed in an order where dependent packages are
# built after their dependencies.
#
# Options that can be added to a package line:
#
#  --bundle b   Include the package in bundle b and not the default
#               full bundle.
#
# Note that there is no need to make decisions for RPM- or Debian-only
# builds in this file; if there is no packaging information for an OS
# family in with the sources, it will not be built.
