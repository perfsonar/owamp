        <h2>OWAMP TCP/UDP Port Usage and Firewall Configuration</h2>

        <p>owamp uses 2 different sets of ports:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Main daemon listening port for control connection
            (<em>Default: TCP/861</em>)</li> <br> <dl> <dt>Defined using the
                <em>port</em> portion of the <em>srcnode</em> configuration
                option from <a
                    href="owampd.conf.man.html">owampd.conf</a>.</dt> <dd>
                <p>For example, to enable this on a typical RHEL 4 system, you
                would need to add the following line to
                /etc/sysconfig/iptables:</p>
<pre>
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 861 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
                <p> This should be
                added somewhere *after* the line that allows ESTABLISHED and
                RELATED connections through.</p> <p> (Note that this does not
                use the system-config-securitylevel script from Redhat. I have
                not been able to get that to do all the things I needed.) </p>
                </dd> </dl>

            <li>OWAMP test flows (<em>Default: UDP/ephemeral range</em>)</li>
            <br> <dl>
                <dt>Defined using the <em>testports</em> configuration
                option from <a href="owampd.conf.man.html">owampd.conf</a>, or
                the <em>-P</em> option to <a
                    href="owping.man.html">owping</a>.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                <p>If you
                specified <em>testports</em> as
                <a href="#badrange">910-950 *</a>, you would then need to enable
                this range in your firewall configuration. (If you do not
                specify a range, owamp will only work reliably if you have open
                access for the entire ephemeral port range.)</p> <p>It is
                important to note, that you can only specify the port for the
                local side of the test. This same range is used for specifying
                the local port for both sending and receiving test packets.
                Therefore, your firewall configuration will need to accept any
                packets arriving for this port range, or departing from this
                port range.  </p> <p>On a typical RHEL 4 system, you would need
                to add the following line to /etc/sysconfig/iptables given this
                range:</p>
<pre>
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m udp -p udp --dport 910:950 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
                <p> The default rule for the OUTPUT chain is to allow
                anything through. If your firewall is more strict than this,
                you will need to explicitly allow this same range of UDP ports
                through that chain using the --sport option.
                </p>
                <p>
                <a name="badrange">* Note that this specific range would be a
                    very bad idea because non-root users would not be able to
                    run owping. (They could not bind the low-numbered port.) I
                    have specifically picked this because I don't want my
                    example to become a de facto port range specification for
                    owamp test traffic, thereby allowing owamp traffic to be
                    classified.</a>
